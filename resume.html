        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p> My name is Emily Blanchard and I am a Graphic Designer! First, a little about me; I am 20 years old, based in the Triangle area of North Carolina. I work incredibly hard spending majority of my time working or advancing in school. Any free time that I do find, I love to spend reading, going outdoors, or finding new hobbies to take up. My wonderful boyfriend and I also love to travel and see as many amazing places the world has to offer while we can, and have made so many amazing memories so far.</p>
          <p>I knew I wanted to be in Graphic Design when I became the editor of my school's yearbook my senior year. I was a part of the yearbook staff all throughout highschool, where I learned a lot of skills in journalism, photography, marketing, design, etc. I am currently attending Wake Tech Community college for an Associates Degree in Advertising and Graphic Design. Here, I am learning all the ropes of not only graphic design, but web design, user experience/interface, marketing, and so much more!</p>
        <p>I am just beginning my career in Graphic Design and am unsure of the specific area I want to dive into. This leaves an ocean of opportunity! Using the skills I have gained, I plan to start my career in freelance and continue to expand my knowledge and experience as my business grows. I am open to any opportunity to grow my career and business. </p>
